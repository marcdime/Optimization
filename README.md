# Preamble : 

The repo is split into two part : 
- Part 1 : Travelling Saleman problem (TSP). It is to find the shortest path, so man can visit all cities without visiting the same twice.  
- Part 2 : classical unimodal and multimodal functions shifted with a biais  

# Part 1 : Discrete problem

In this part, we use the "satsp" package (version 0.9) to solve the TSP problem.

First install it by the command

```linux
pip install satsp
```
